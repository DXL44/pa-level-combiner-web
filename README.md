# pa-level-combiner-web
 Website that lets you upload multiple Project Arrhythmia level files (.lsb) and mash them together for collabs.

# What is this?
This is a web tool that allows you to combine multiple Project Arrhythmia custom level files together into a single file. It's useful for collabs - where it can allow people to work independently without waiting for members to finish. 

It's inspired mostly by [TNTz's Python level combiner](https://github.com/TNTzx/PA-Level-Combiner/), and aims to do what that does but in a webpage format which is a bit more accessible or easier to use for some.
